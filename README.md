# Assignment 11: Dicts and Tuples

This assignment gives you hands-on practice with core Python container types beyond lists—**tuples** and **dictionaries**. You’ll write small functions that use tuple packing/unpacking, work with immutable tuple values, and perform common dictionary operations such as counting, grouping, safe lookups, and transforming nested structures.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use **tuples** for fixed-structure data and multi-value returns  
   - Create, index, and slice tuples  
   - Pack/unpack values (including starred unpacking)  
   - Understand tuple immutability and when to prefer tuples over lists

2. Work fluently with **dictionaries**  
   - Create and update key/value pairs, including `dict.get`, `setdefault`, and `update`  
   - Iterate over `keys`, `values`, and `items`  
   - Build frequency maps and invert/sort dictionaries by value

3. Manipulate **nested data** that combines dicts, lists, and tuples  
   - Aggregate values into lists by key (grouping)  
   - Validate and normalize mixed structures  
   - Write clear, testable helper functions for nested containers

## Assignment Structure

The assignment consists of **three exercises**, each in its own folder under the root `assn-11-yourusername/`.  
Each exercise will provide a starter file with one primary function to complete, a short README with task details, and automated tests.

- Exercise 1: focuses on tuples (creation, unpacking, and return conventions)
- Exercise 2: focuses on dictionaries (lookups, counting, and transformations)

> Note: Folder names are intentionally left blank and will be provided separately.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference [PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) if you need a refresher.

In summary:

1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions.
2. Run the scripts to test and debug.
3. Execute the automated tests to ensure expected functionality.

When finished, do not forget to:

1. **Commit and Sync**
   - Switch to version control tab
   - Stage all changed files
   - _**Enter a commit message**_
   - Click **Commit**
   - Click **Sync**
2. **Validate** your submission in GitHub
3. **Submit** the final commit ID in D2L
